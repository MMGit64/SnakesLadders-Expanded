# SnakesLadders-Expanded

Editor: Mustafa Mossa

In this program, using the reuse-orientated principle I have implemented the code for 'rockPaperScissors' into 'SnakesAndLadders'.

The game starts out with a single round of rock paper scissors. 
Whoever wins this round will be the player that rolls the dice first for snakes and ladders. Fair game.

Enjoy!
